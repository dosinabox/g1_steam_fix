===============================================================

WHY THIS PATCH:

The only English Patch for Gothic 1 - Gothic Unofficial Patch 1.0 (http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/806121-Release-Gothic-Unofficial-Patch-1-0) by Ironkeep Studios was released in 2010. It fixed several well-known bugs that were present in the last official release, 1.08k, while some other issues remained unaddressed.

Gothic 1 Unofficial Patch (EN_G1_UnPatch) is an attempt to resolve such unadressed issues. It's main inspiration is the excellent German PG-DB Patch Mod (http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1033558-Gothic1-Patch-Mod-%28PerfectGothic-DunkleBrut%29), while some other issues were corrected following the solutions provided by Dimus (http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/614018-Bugs-from-Gothic-1-You-d-Want-To-See-Fixed!) and petermj.

Please consider that this patch is suitable only for the English version of Gothic 1.
